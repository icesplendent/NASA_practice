To raise people‚Äôs awareness about how important ocean and phytoplankton are in human‚Äôs everyday life, our team integrates ocean knowledge with interactive games. We depict the marine ecosystem as a garden and engage players in a ‚Äútreasure hunt game‚Äù that progressively imparts knowledge about ocean, carbon cycle, and phytoplankton. Through this user-friendly website, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap among the general public and hope to raise the awareness of ocean ecosystem.


## Summary
Ocean serves not only as a major energy provider but also as the world's greatest ally against climate change, especially with phytoplankton playing a vital role in maintaining carbon balance. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of ocean knowledge for the general public, a significant knowledge gap often leads to human activities that damages marine ecosystem, subsequently exacerbating climate change. Recognizing this problem, our team determine to popularize ocean knowledge and bring it into people's lives by visually, sonically, and interactively game website, frOG.

To deliver knowledge and truly involve people into ocean world, our team utilize ocean data and knowledge in two ways. <br>
Firstly, we integrate marine data, such as what role does phytoplankton plays in ocean ecosystem and how it affects our life, into game. By answering questions, players are able to acquire knowledge in an interesting and easy way. Additionally, NASA ocean color images are provided to give them the sense of how does ocean and phytoplankton look like when viewed from outer space. <br>

Secondly, we collect 2002 to 2023 chlorophyll data and present them on our 3D global. Players can observe the global distribution of phytoplankton concentration and they also can click on the color bar besides 3D global to know more about how ocean and phytoplankton affects our living environment. Furthermore, since seasons affect phytoplankton‚Äôs distribution, we also design a ‚Äúsummer/winter button‚Äù which presents the change between two seasons.<br>

In our game website, we hope to create immersive experience that the general public can learn through playing. Hence, we also emphasize virtual and sonic UIUX. Guided by main character, Mr. Chu, players are introduced into the learning environment we designed. To ensure the gaming experience is complete and smooth, minor characters, below 3D global, are placed to give game hints and additional information to players. For the interactive design, there are marked location labels on 3D global and chlorophyll timeline slider for further introduction. Last but not least, we also embed sound effects to enhance visual memory.<br>

In the future, we hope to integrate more data, such as worldwide temperature change, carbon dioxide concentration, and marine organisms productivity, to compare with chlorophyll concentration. Information about the condition of other phytoplankton species and locations are expected to be explore and update to our website.
